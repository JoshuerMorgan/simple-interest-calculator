🧮 How It Works
User Inputs:

Principal amount (must be a positive number)

Interest rate (controlled via slider)

Number of years

Computation:

Formula: Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

Final amount = Principal + Interest

Future year is calculated from the current year

Output:

Displays calculated amount and the future year of return

Validation:

Ensures the principal is a valid positive number

Checks that a valid number of years is entered

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the content

CSS3 for styling and layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) for logic and interactivity

Bootstrap 5 for modern UI components
